# Flashboard Demo Store

This open-source project demonstrates integrating [Flashboard](https://www.getflashboard.com) into a modern React stack. It showcases a naive e-commerce experience using Flashboard as a CMS and an admin panel. You can go to Flashboard and create a DEMO panel, which is used in this demo's [live version](https://demo.getflashboard.com).
